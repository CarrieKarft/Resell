            <h1 style={{color: 'red'}}>THIS APPLICATION IS A SCHOOL PROJECT! RESELL IS NOT A REAL BUISNESS AND EVERYTING OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION IS FAKE</h1>
            <h3>For Sellers:</h3>
            <p>Resell is a platform to list your used items. After listing your item, you will be sent a shipping label so that you can ship your item to Resell, and we handle the rest. Each item on Resell will be posted for a set amount of time. During that time, users are able to place bids on the item, and the user with the highest bid will get to purchase the item. Once the item is sold to the person with the highest bid, Resell will send you the amount the item was purchased for, minus a few fees. You get paid, and we do most of the work. That sounds great, right?</p>
            <h3>For Customers:</h3>
            <p>At Resell, we value closing the loop on fashion waste and prolonging the lifespan of items that would have otherwise ended up in the trash. Additionally, we take item quality very seriously, which is why we personally examine products before shipping them to customers. Trying to balance these two values can at times be challenging, which is why we participate in a clothing recycling program. After an item has been available to purchase for a set amount of time, or if items come in that aren't up to our standards, we recycle them to help make insulation for homes made by Habitat for Humanity. To purchase items, you will place a bid on the item, and the person with the highest bid will be able to purchase the item once the time limit is up. If you place a bid and someone outbids you, you can edit your bid. You are also able to place comments on items. Resell is a place for all people, so any comments that violate our comment guidelines will be deleted.</p>
